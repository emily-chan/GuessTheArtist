Contributions for Submission #1: I gave input for how the game should be played. I tested that the program worked as expected. I made edits so it passed checkstyle in jenkins.

Future contributions: Work on finishing host and client features for the game. Help with accessing Twitter API to implement sentiment analysis to calculate clients' scores.

Contributions for Submission #3: I tested the sentiment analysis point awarding feature. I debugged the code and fixed errors to ensure it worked properly.

Future contributions: Work on completing the rest of the features, including the timer and hints.
