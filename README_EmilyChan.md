Contributions for Submission #1: I gave input for how the game should be played. I tested that the program worked as expected. I made edits so it passed checkstyle in jenkins.

Future contributions: Work on finishing host and client features for the game. Help with accessing Twitter API to implement sentiment analysis to calculate clients' scores.
