Contributions;
  began research and development of spotify play back for the game 
 
restrictions:
  seems that spotify play back is only accessible through html and webpages
  
future work: 
  figuring out how to work around the restrictions
  
final contributions: I Qorked with Kiara to figure out spotify play back without implementing a webpage, 
  but it was unsuccessful. The spotify playback that we intended for did not work, depsite the use of 
  the Wrapper classes that were out there. Was unsuccessful to integrate Spotify with the docker container
